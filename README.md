## Description <a name="description"></a>
This app uses MongoDB to make a simple social network API. Users can be created, have their info updated, be friends with other users, and can be deleted. Users can also have thoughts, which act as small text snippets attached to that user. Users can also react to thoughts, which act sort of like thoughts themselves. Reactions have their own id's and can be deleted.
